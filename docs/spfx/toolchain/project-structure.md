# SharePoint Framework project structure

SharePoint Framework projects consist of a number of files and folders, each with its own purpose. This article provides you with more information about what these files and folders are, and what they are meant to be used for.

> **Note:** The SharePoint Framework is currently in preview and is subject to change. SharePoint Framework client-side web parts are not currently supported for use in production environments.
